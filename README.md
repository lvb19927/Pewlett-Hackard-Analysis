# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of Analysis:
The data given from Pewlett-Hackard was used to find out how many employees are set to retire in order to metric how prepared the company is to lose people in the "silver tsunami". Another aspect was mentorship eligibility and mentorship capabilities. Using SQL, we were able to summise how many people are able to take part in mentoring.
## Results:
- We created a table using the birth dates in the data to show who in the company was of retiring age.

The image above is the result of SQL coding which shows the amount of retirees (expected).

- Then we created a new table that shows who will lose the most employees in a certain role!

The image above shows that senior engineers and senior staff will have the highest amount of retirees.

- Next, we had to make sure the company was prepared for such a loss of employee knowledge. Using a different age data point, we created a list of employees who would be able to bridge the gap under a *mentorship program*.

- Altogether, there are only 1549 people eligible to be mentored - not nearly enough to combat the "silver tsunami" about to wipe the company out.

## Summary
### How many roles need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
There is total of 72,458 roles, mostly senior positions, that will need to be filled.

The image above shows the positions once again.

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard employees?
![mentor_eligible](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117100491/214630613-3feab1e8-167f-4abf-bb87-e4e344a615c2.png)

The image above expounds on those able to mentor the next generation.

While Pewlett-Hackard has plenty of retirement-ready employees that could do the mentoring, they do not have enough people eligible for the mentorship program. If the company is able to fill the roles, they will still be in need of a better leadership program or some sort of eligibility increase in order to satiate the thralls of the "silver tsunami".
